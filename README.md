## Project Overview

My Strain Book, is an app that helps you keep tract of all your favorite, and most effective marijuana strains. In the app users are prompted to select a strain from a dropdown -- where upon selecting a strain -- they will be presented with that strain's info. Info includes: the name, race (sativa, hybrid, and indica), and effects: positive, negative, and medical. If the user wishes they can click a button to save to favorites and be able to click an experiences tab to view all their favorites.

## Challenges
* Using various hooks supplied by react
* Writing asynchronous integration tests
* Managing data down and actions up
* Pulling in an anonymous object for the data set
* Adding a unique key for each `.map` method

## Wins
* Successfully pulling in and passing data around to solve a problem
* Writing async test functions to test the app
* Major growth with using CSS and CSS Grid
* Successfully used `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state

## Roadmap
With more time, I would like to enhance the UI/UX by:
* Adding user authentication
* Enable a memo input for the user to add comments
* Add ability to share favorite strains with other users
* Add post or patch method to allow users to save favorites on a server
